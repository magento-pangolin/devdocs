<!-- What's need to be covered in this topic?

1. Why people would need credentials in the MFTF?
    - Credentials are used for when you need to input an integration token or other security credential via a `fillField`.
    - You shouldn't have security tokens checked in to any repo, so storing it in a DATA.xml file is a bad idea
    - Furthermore, if you used data.xml, the Allure Report would show your security token like:
        I fill field "SECURITYTOKEN".
        - Use of {{_CREDS.TOKEN}} turns a `fillField` action into `fillSecretField` which scrubs the allure report.

2. What functionality does the MFTF credentials feauture cover?
    - How to store credentials
        - build:project copies over .credentials.example, copy and remove the `.example`
        - Store new credentials in a new line as `KEY=VALUE`
    - How to use Credentials in test actions
        - In fillField actions, you can reference it as {{_CREDS.KEY}}
        - data.md has info on this, check out "Sensitive Data"

3. How to implement credentials in test design?
    - Credentials should only every be used if you have the need to connect to some external integration for your test
    - Credentials should NOT be used to store stuff like Username/Password in your sandbox test environment; should be limited to tokens and passwords that would propose a security risk.

3. How to setup cerdentials?
    - build:project copies over .credentials.example, copy and remove the `.example`
    - Store new credentials in a new line as
        - KEY=VALUE
    - You CANNOT check in the .credentials file
        - For Magneto Devs, DevOps is still working on the solution of how to store credentials to be used in a build enviroment
        - For outside Devs, they can store the credentials and build their own .credentials file as part of build steps

4. Examples of daily routine tasks using credentials in the MFTF.
    - In my test, I am wanting to test a Payment Method integration. This requires me to add a Payment via the Configuration page in the admin backend.
    - I need to use the credentials to my Sandbox Environment, but I don't want those visible in the Allure Report:
        - <fillField stepKey="FillAPIUsername" selector=".username" userInput="{{_CREDS.PAYMENTUSER}}"/>
        - <fillField stepKey="FillAPIPassword" selector=".password" userInput="{{_CREDS.PAYMENTPASSWORD}}"/>

5. DevOps specific examples.
    - DevOps still doesn't have a full integration for adding your own .credentials.

6. Reference documentation like in https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/magento-functional-testing-framework/2.3/configuration.html
